		<font face="comic sans ms">
		The Sun temple is situated in the small town of Konark, which is situated in the Puri district of Odisha.<br>This marvel of architecture is dedicated to Lord Sun. And resembling his carriage, the temple has been built in the shape of a chariot, which has twelve wheels and is shown as being dragged by the seven horses.<br>The temple is believed to be constructed in the 13th century by a king called Narasimhadeva. Like with most things in India, this temple too has connections with a few legends. <br>As per one of the legends, God Krishna cursed, one of his own sons with leprosy. <br>To seek penance, Samba worshiped Lord Sun (Surya) for a period of twelve years. Pleased with his devotion, Surya healed him.<br>Samba made the Sun temple in return to express his gratitude.
